Deep Fruit Counting

This project implements a method for counting fruit on tree canopies using video sequences.   Currently, it takes a set of still images as input, and outputs bounding boxes as well as a total fruit count.
The method uses optical flow for object tracking and Faster R-CNN for object detection.
